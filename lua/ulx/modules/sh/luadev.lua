-- ULX variants of luadev's aowl chat commands (luadev_chatcmds.lua), for a server with ULX and no
-- aowl: "ulx l" in the console, "!l" in chat. ULX includes this module on both sides; the commands
-- run on the server. ULX's access decides who may call them, as aowl's groups
-- did: lm is every player's, the rest are superadmins'. A run on the server tells its caller, in
-- chat, the lines it printed, else the values it returned, else that it ran; clients do
-- not answer, so a run only on them tells nothing. Its caller's client hears how it went: a
-- success cue, an error cue, or, for work it returned still going a frame later (a transaction:
-- a value with State() and OnSettle(fn)), a blip, then the cue for how the work settled; still going once it is no longer
-- listened for, it is told so, with a neutral cue, and its end goes unheard. Each is a server convar
-- a server.cfg sets, read as it is used: sv_luadev_output_maxlines (lines told, 0 for none),
-- _maxchars (a line's length, 0 for whole), _timeout (seconds listened), and the sounds
-- _success, _error, _progress and _neutral (a path, empty for none).
